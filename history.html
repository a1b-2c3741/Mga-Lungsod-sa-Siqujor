      <h4>Siquijor</h4>
      <p>
        Siquijor, the capital municipality of the province, was established as a town in 1794, coinciding with the founding of its parish. The island was first sighted by Spaniards in 1565 during Miguel LÃ³pez de Legazpi's expedition and was named "Isla del Fuego" or "Island of Fire" due to the eerie glow from swarms of fireflies in its molave trees. The town has a rich history, including periods under the jurisdictions of Bohol and later Negros Oriental before becoming an independent province in 1971. The capital was officially transferred to Siquijor town in 1972.
